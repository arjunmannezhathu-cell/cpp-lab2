# fullgametest Explanation

## What is this?
This is the **Grand Finale Test**. It's like a "dress rehearsal" for an entire game.

## What is its job? (Duties)
It simulates an ENTIRE match of Battleship. It does everything:
1. Places all 10 ships.
2. Fires dozens of shots.
3. Successfully sinks every single ship on the board.
4. Prints the boards at every step so you can see the progress.

## Why do we use it?
It's the ultimate proof that every single piece of the project (Grids, Ships, Console, Shots) works together in harmony. If this test passes, the whole project is ready for the professional world!
