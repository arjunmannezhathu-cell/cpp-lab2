# part3tests Explanation

## What is this?
This is a **Battlefield Simulation Check**.

## What is its job? (Duties)
It tests what happens when the game is actually in motion:
- If a ship sits on A1-A2, and you shoot A1, is it a "Hit"? (Yes)
- If you then shoot A2, is it "Sunken"? (Yes)
- Does the enemy's radar map correctly "solve" where your sunken ships were? (Yes)

## Why do we use it?
This ensures that the "scorekeeping" of the game is accurate. We want to make sure that when you hit a ship, the game actually notices!
